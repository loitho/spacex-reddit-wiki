# What are the contracts that SpaceX and other companies have signed with NASA?

It's best to delineate the programs along two tracks: cargo and crew.

**Cargo** (COTS, CRS, CRS2)

* **COTS** ([Commercial Orbital Transportation Services](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commercial_Orbital_Transportation_Services)): program to fund development and demonstration flights of commercial orbital cargo transportation services. I suggest reading the [final COTS report](http://www.nasa.gov/content/nasa-releases-cots-final-report/#.VJBoyyvF98E) for a really comprehensive background.
* **CRS** ([Commercial Resupply Services](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commercial_Resupply_Services)): contracts for ongoing delivery of cargo to the ISS. SpaceX's next CRS mission will be CRS-8, with a NET date of January 3rd. CRS2 will be a new contract (so new competition), starting deliveries around 2016; you can see the [Request for Proposal](http://procurement.jsc.nasa.gov/crs2/) (RFP) here. It is between Lockheed-Martin's Exoliner, Sierra Nevada's Dreamchaser, Orbital ATK's Cygnus, and SpaceX.

**Crew [(CCDev)](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commercial_Crew_Development)** (phases: CCDev1, CCDev2, CCiCap, CPC, CCtCap)

* **CCDev1** ([Commercial Crew Development 1](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commercial_Crew_Development#CCDev_1)): Space Act Agreements to develop some technologies and systems for human spaceflight. Note that SpaceX was not a participant in CCDev1.
* **CCDev2** ([Commercial Crew Development 2](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commercial_Crew_Development#CCDev_2)): Proposals for development of vehicles for human spaceflight to the ISS. Several proposals were selected for funding and others were unfunded. Funded ones were Blue Origin, SNC, SpaceX, and Boeing.
* **CCiCap** ([Commercial Crew Integrated Capability](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commercial_Crew_Development#Commercial_Crew_integrated_Capability)): Proposals for a complete design of crew services including the spacecraft, launch vehicle, services, and recovery. Winners were SpaceX, SNC, and Boeing. Boeing has completed all of their CCiCap milestones; SNC and SpaceX are finishing theirs up. Note that milestones are different for each company, mostly due to the fact that each company started out CCiCap at different points in the development process.
* **CPC** ([Certification Products Contract](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commercial_Crew_Development#Certification_Products_Contract_.28CPC.29_phase_1)): Review of the integrated systems and progress towards developing a certification plan. All CCiCap winners continue through this phase.
* **CCtCap** ([Commercial Crew Transportation Capability](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commercial_Crew_Development#Commercial_Crew_Transportation_Capability_.28CCtCap.29)): the program for certification of the spacecraft/launch vehicle systems for human spaceflight, including their final phases of development, testing, and verification. Culminates in manned test flights to the ISS, after which some other CRS-like contract will begin for purchasing of routine crew flights. Winners were SpaceX and Boeing.
