# What does Elon Musk mean when he says Mars is a "fixer-upper of a planet"?

Mars is a planet that is currently hostile to life; Musk is talking about the process of terraforming it to make it less hostile. Lots of terraforming discussions mention things like giant space mirrors, without ever considering how ridiculously huge and impossible these would be. Using currently available technologies, Mars could be warmed up by the use of greenhouse gases. On Earth, carbon dioxide warms the atmosphere, as it (through the process of absorption and emission of radiation) "reflects" heat back at the planet. But it's not that efficient, and there are lots of other gases that have a better "Global-Warming Potential". The best candidate by far is sulfur hexafluoride (SF*_6_*), which has a GWP of tens of thousands better than CO*_2_*. SF*_6_* could be easily produced on Mars - giant factories could be built, belching the stuff into the atmosphere. It is also extremely dense, so clings to the surface, and settles at the bottom of craters and valleys, where colonists would most likely be living. As the planet warms, the CO*_2_* permafrost will melt, boosting atmospheric pressure, and warming the planet further in a runaway greenhouse effect.
