# Can Dragon 1 be used to evacuate the ISS?

Dragon 1 would make a very poor lifeboat for the ISS. The CRS Dragon does not dock, instead it "berths" to the ISS - this is not automated/machine controlled. Berthing is a tedious process whereby astronauts carefully maneuver the capsule into place using Canadarm, and then physically bolt the CBM ports together. To unberth, the reverse must occur. It is a very slow process; far too slow for a quick escape. There are two Soyuzes attached to Station that are always there and ready to at a moments notice, so it is difficult to imagine a scenario where you'd have to use Dragon as a escape pod... In addition, on top of providing a slow evacuation, the Dragon is only there a month at a time, once every ~6 months or so, has no seats, and is likely to be (at least partially) filled with cargo.
