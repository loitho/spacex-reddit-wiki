# How dangerous are the perchlorate salts found in Martian soil?

Perchlorate salts, such as calcium perchlorate (Ca(ClO*_4_*)*_2_*), are widespread in Martian soils at concentrations between 0.5 and 1%. At such concentrations, perchlorates represent a significant chemical hazard to astronauts. Perchlorates are toxic as they interfere with thyroid function, if they get in your bloodstream. They're also a fairly nasty irritant to exposed skin, due to their oxidising nature. However, though the hazard is large, the risk need not be.

It's important to understand that all chemicals are poisonous above a certain threshold particular to that compound. The management of hazardous chemicals (those with a relatively low threshold) focuses on keeping their concentration below that threshold in locations where they can cause harm. When using the appropriate Personal Protective Equipment, and the right safety procedures, perchlorates should never come into contact with human tissue. Contaminated suits can easily be decontaminate: calcium perchlorate is very soluble in water; 188 grams will dissolve in 100 millilitres of water at 20 °C. Once you have it in aqueous solution, it should be easy to deal with. Perchlorates are pretty reactive (there's a reason they were used in the shuttle solid rocket boosters!), and so can be neutralised through a variety of chemical pathways. Even if that fails, you can just blast them with heat. Calcium perchlorate decomposes above ~300 °C into calcium chloride, calcium oxide and usable oxygen gas.
