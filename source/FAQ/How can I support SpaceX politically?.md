# How can I support SpaceX politically?

If you live in the United States, you can contact elected officials and tell them how much you support NASA's commercial space program. [This link](http://www.senate.gov/reference/common/faq/How_to_contact_senators.htm) explains how to contact your Senator, and [this link](http://www.usa.gov/Contact/US-Congress.shtml) explains how to contact your Representative. Politicians will always be interested to hear the opinions of the electorate who keep them in office, and they'll be keen to support commercial space if they know that's what the people want. Happy lobbying!
