# I'm at Cape Canaveral. Where's the best place to watch the launch?

Falcon 9 rockets launch from SLC-40 at Cape Canaveral [(map)](https://goo.gl/LwgvdR). [Here is a map image](http://i.imgur.com/NEWAKIM.jpg) of some of the available options. Yellow sites indicate restricted access.

This is a very frequently asked question. See [here](http://redd.it/1zxt5z), [here](http://redd.it/1kzcb0), [here](http://redd.it/21cubj), [here](http://redd.it/1ztq4e), and [here](http://redd.it/1z1lna) for more discussion.

Early and late launches may make some of these sites not available. Availability may be limited and KSC may open certain cites on certain launches. *It pays to check beforehand if the site will be open.*

Another good resource is [launchphotography.com](http://www.launchphotography.com/Delta_4_Atlas_5_Falcon_9_Launch_Viewing.html) Scroll down to Section 2.

Returning rockets land at Landing Complex 1 [(map)](https://goo.gl/DETftl). This facility is located south and east of the SLC-40 launch site.
You will get a much better view outside KSC if you bring binoculars.
