# What is the intended use of SpaceX's private Boca Chica, Texas launch site?

The Texas launch site is planned to absorb SpaceX's (predicted) overcapacity caused by currently having a single launch site that can boost directly into LEO/GTO. It will mainly be used for commercial missions (such as comsats), while most Dragon-related and human-rated missions will be flown out of SLC-40. Pad 39A will take up the military/defense related missions and perhaps some human-rated missions too. Saying that, even Pad9A is unlikely to be big enough for BFR/MCT, so it is possible that SpaceX will have 3 launch sites in Florida one day. Additionally, having a private launch site is advantageous as SpaceX will not need to work around launch times for other range customers (such as the Air Force and government - missions whose priority usually exceed that of a commercial launch), which has been a source of delays in the past.
