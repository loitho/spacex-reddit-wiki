# What are the four towers around the SLC-40 launch pad for?

These are lightning towers; they prevent lightning from hitting and so damaging or destroying the rocket on the launch pad. Because Florida experiences a [lot of lightning](http://www.lightningsafety.noaa.gov/stats/97-11Flash_Density_miles.png), all active launch complexes in the area need to have them. [Lightning have actually hit the towers](https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/508457119037681665), just before the AsiaSat 6 launch.

SpaceX's other Florida Pad, 39A, includes a single lightning tower mounted atop the Fixed Service Structure. Because Vandenberg experiences generally fine weather, situated in a mediterranean climate; it has no need for lightning towers and thus does not have them.
