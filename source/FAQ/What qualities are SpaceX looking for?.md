# What qualities are SpaceX looking for?

SpaceX look for people who can strongly demonstrate initiative, drive and intelligence. Formal training in mechanical/electrical/software engineering at college would stand you in very good stead. In addition, SpaceX are always interested to hear about extra-curricular activities: that bottle rocket you built at age 8, the door you fixed at 10, the boxcar you built at 12, that website you designed at 14, the bridge you engineered at 16, etc. In particular, SpaceX seem to like people who have taken part in Formula SAE, or have experience in video game development. Emphasize your ability to fix problems with ingenuity and personal drive; being able to do this is almost more important than is an engineering degree. Normally, you have to be a US person (Citizen, Naturalized Citizen, or LPR) due to ITAR requirements (but exceptions have been made).
