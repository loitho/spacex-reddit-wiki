# I'll be near a launch site soon. What are the chances of getting to see the launch?

The answer to this depends on how long until the launch is scheduled. SpaceX is still a relatively young spaceflight company, and have still not yet established a reliable launch cadence and are occasionally subject to delays. That said, all rocket launches experience delays to some degree (spaceflight is hard), *so do not plan your travels around rocket launches!*
