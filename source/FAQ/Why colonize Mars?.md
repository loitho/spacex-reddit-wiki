# Why colonize Mars?

This question is best answered by Elon Musk and Gwynne Shotwell themselves:

> "What are the important steps in the evolution of life? Obviously there is the advent of single celled life, there was differentiation between plants and animals, there was life going from the oceans onto land, there was mammals, consciousness, and I would argue also on that scale, should fit life becoming multi-planetary. And I think, that if one could make a reasonable argument that something is important enough to fit on the scale of evolution, then it is important. And maybe worth a little bit of our resources."

\- Elon Musk

> "I think there are two perspectives that are important. Exploration is really what separates humans from other living species. If we decide that where we are today is 'it,' that seems like a big disappointment. The other piece, the kinda scary piece, is it's really risk management for humanity. The probability of a significant event happening on Earth is very high. When will it happen? I don't know when it will happen, but I'm pretty sure there will be a catastrophic event, and it would be nice to have humans living in more than one spot. [...] I cannot think of anything more important than promoting humanity beyond a single location. We're a single point failure!"

\- Gwynne Shotwell
