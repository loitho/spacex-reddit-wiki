# I'm at Vandenberg. Where's the best place to watch the launch?

Falcon flies less frequently from Vandenberg Air Force Base than it does from the East Coast, but there's still a lot of interest in watching the launches. See [here](http://redd.it/1kzcb0/) and [here](https://redd.it/3zllm9) for discussion about how to watch the launch. See [here](https://redd.it/415ppz) for tips on viewing by a former staffer at the launch site.

SpaceX launch from [Space Launch Complex 4 East (SLC-4E)](https://goo.gl/EnxH8E). Viewing rocket launches from Vandenberg AFB can be tricky, as the entire base is closed off for non-military personnel at all times. You're going to have to stick to public roads. Rockets fly in a southern direction going out over the Channel Islands, and the launch pads are in a hilly area which partially blocks the view. On most days there is a marine overcast layer, which rolls out in the morning and back in the afternoon, and on some days it can be foggy.

The best place to watch launches from SLC-4E is at [Surf Beach](https://goo.gl/GcizOT), if the Sheriff does not close access to the beach. If it is closed there will be two police cars on Ocean Road just past 13th street; the closest you can then get is the [parking lot](https://goo.gl/y39xJI) at the western extreme of Ocean Road. Getting there early is essential, as the parking lot is very small, the road is narrow and parking along the side of the road is often limited. If Surf Beach is closed or Ocean Road is over-crowded, the best alternatives are [Renwick Road](https://goo.gl/Hhro7R) (the hills will block the view until it gets about a half mile up) or [Harris Grade Road](https://goo.gl/BmLP7s) (you'll be higher up so you'll see it sooner, but you'll be further away).
