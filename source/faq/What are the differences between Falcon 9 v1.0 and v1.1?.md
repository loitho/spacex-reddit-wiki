# What are the differences between Falcon 9 v1.0 and v1.1?

As of Flight 6 (CASSIOPE) in September 2013, the Falcon 9 moved to version 1.1, which completely replaced the older v1.0. Musk himself has stated that when they designed v1.0 they "didn't really know what we were doing". The Falcon 9 v1.1 has a larger payload capacity, has a more reliable design, and is built using simpler and cheaper manufacturing processes. The main differences between the v1.0 and v1.1 include the use of the more powerful Merlin 1D engine, an "octaweb" engine layout which replaces the older "tic-tac-toe" layout on the first stage, and stretched propellant tanks that are 60% larger on the first and second stage.
