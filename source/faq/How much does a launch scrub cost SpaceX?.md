# How much does a launch scrub cost SpaceX?

It's obviously not possible to come up with a fixed value for such a relatively unique event (as obviously a scrub where they launch the following day would be cheaper than a scrub where they need to bring the rocket back to horizontal and check it over), but we can estimate the costs that SpaceX would incur. Everyone at SpaceX is likely salaried, and the pad crew (who may or may not actually qualify as a salaried job) probably are too. So the overtime to be paid is likely minimal. They have to pay the Air Force to do launches from CCAFS, but only they and the AF know how that is structured and what a scrub costs. There's probably a fixed cost for reconfiguring the range for another launch if the delay is long enough that someone else launches between attempts. If they get to pressurization then they are likely losing a lot of helium, which is more expensive than the entire load of LOX. In addition, recovery assets also need to be paid. Fuel for a big ship is not cheap to go out a few hundred miles and return.
