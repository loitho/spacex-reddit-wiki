# Could Falcon launch the Mars 2020 Rover?

For all intents and purposes, no. Falcon 9 does not have the capacity to deliver the required payload towards Mars (nearly 4000kg), thus does not have the ability to do so. Falcon Heavy could, but will not have flown enough missions by 2020 for it to be considered a reliable launch vehicle in NASA's eyes, and would also have to be 'nuclear rated' to carry the rovers Radioisotope Thermoelectric Generator (RTG) that provides it with power. Saying all this is relatively moot however; Mars 2020 it is preliminarily scheduled to fly on an Atlas V (which achieves 8 tons to GTO). See this NASA PDF for more details about [MSL/Mars 2020](http://solarsystem.nasa.gov/docs/MSL_Landing_20120724.pdf).
