# Why did Elon Musk found SpaceX?

Elon Musk founded SpaceX out of frustration with the slow technological development pace of human spaceflight. After trying to negotiate a launch with the purpose of landing a "greenhouse" on Mars in order to reinvigorate NASA, Musk quickly realised that the reason for slow progress was no lack of will, but the extraordinarily high cost of putting something - anything - into orbit.

The primary aim of SpaceX from the outset was to build a simple and relatively inexpensive reusable rocket system that could go into space multiple times, with a similar turn-around time capabilities that commercial airliners currently exhibit. By enabling cheap and easy access to space, the idea is that this will enable humans to settle other planets, and become a multi-planet species.
