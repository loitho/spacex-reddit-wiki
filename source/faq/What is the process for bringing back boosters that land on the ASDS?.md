# What is the process for bringing back boosters that land on the ASDS?

The first job is to secure the booster. While the center of gravity is pretty low for the booster, as all the engines and residual propellant is at the bottom, SpaceX also tie the rocket down to the droneship to prevent it from potentially sliding during transport. Then the tug Elsbeth III tows the ASDS back to port. At port, the booster is lifted off the barge using a crane, and placed onto a stand which supports the weight of the booster from the launch hold-down point. Once on the stand, the legs are removed, and then the booster is rotated to the horizontal, and placed on the back of a truck, to be taken back to the launch site. At the launch site, the stage is inspected, any required maintenance is carried out, and then a series of test fires are carried out in order to requalify the booster for relaunch.
