# Can Falcon launch from Texas and land in Florida?

No. Elon Musk on Twitter stated: ["Side boosters fall short &amp;amp; center core goes too far + Florida is heavily populated. Landing permission tricky :)"](https://www.twitter.com/elonmusk/status/330395232564826112).

For a Falcon Heavy, the side boosters separate too early to easily travel to the cape. And the center core separates too late. And the larger issue comes in that flying a rocket stage on a ballistic trajectory over populated areas is too dangerous. Whereas a rocket launching from the Cape only travels over land [at the last second](https://i.imgur.com/Z81NgAk.png) (credit u/zlsa), a rocket launching from Texas would have to travel all the way across Florida.
