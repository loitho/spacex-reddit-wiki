# How does Falcon's flight termination system work?

All Falcon rockets have a termination system in the case that an anomalous event is detected. The typical use case for flight termination is when the rocket's instantaneous impact point (IIP) strays outside of some predetermined corridor. The range continuously calculates an IIP during flight, which predicts where the vehicle will impact were thrust to be immediately terminated. If there is a guidance or propulsion failure that prevents the vehicle from being able to reach orbit, the range can terminate pre-emptively to keep the debris in a more controlled area. The termination system Falcon possesses is a cord-like explosive charge that goes down the side of the rocket. It doesn't "blow it up" but rather "unzips" it lengthwise. Following, the rocket disintegrates itself after that and the fuel blows up.
