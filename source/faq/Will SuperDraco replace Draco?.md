# Will SuperDraco replace Draco?

No they won't, as they are designed for entirely different applications. Draco engines have a thrust of 400 N and are used for in-orbit manouvering, orbit adjustments, fine guidance, orientation, and deorbiting. SuperDraco engines put out **73,000 N** of thrust, that makes them 182.5 times more powerful. In fact, a single SuperDraco engine is *more powerful* than the Kestrel upper stage engine of Falcon 1. Firing these in proximity to the ISS would likely obliterate the station.

Even though they can throttle down to [20%](http://www.spacex.com/news/2014/07/31/spacex-launches-3d-printed-part-space-creates-printed-engine-chamber-crewed) (making them merely 36.5 times as powerful as a Draco), to maintain a steady attitude, you'd likely have to fire at least another engine on the opposite side simultaneously.
