# How should I handle myself at a group hiring event?

What SpaceX look for most in engineering candidates is the ability to get things done. SpaceX want candidates who can start a project, hit problems, work past them, and produce at the end of the day. The best recommendation is to focus on the projects you worked on, what did you build, how did you build it, what went wrong, what went right. Above all be prepared to talk about the entire project; if SpaceX ask you about some part of the project and you say weren't responsible that portion and you don't know, that is a red flag that you are bullshitting us.

The best candidates that SpaceX want to hire are the ones who worked on projects, and actually managed to produce things. SpaceX fear people with academic knowledge that have no evidence of ever applying that knowledge. In general, SpaceX hire from better schools and people with better grades, but that probably reflects more that people who know how to get things done end up in those places than that SpaceX actually look for those things.
