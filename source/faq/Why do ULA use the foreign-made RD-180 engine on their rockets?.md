# Why do ULA use the foreign-made RD-180 engine on their rockets?

First, it's worth a quick look at why the US opted to allow a foreign engine in a rocket which lifts the majority of its national security launches. The RD-180 was first studied by General Dynamics (before they became part of Lockheed Martin), and [first flown on an Atlas III](http://www.ilslaunch.com/newsroom/news-releases/lockheed-martin-selects-rd-180-power-atlas-iiar) (also known as Atlas IIAR). The general idea, which was encouraged by the US government, was that Russia had a lot of really smart rocket scientists who were suddenly out of a job after the fall of the USSR. It wouldn't be good for those engineers to pack up and leave for a hostile country, so the US wanted to encourage them to work on something positive. A great price on the best hydrocarbon engine in the world [\(literally, US engineers didn't believe the Russians until witnessing a test](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AyBan_LTjvM) ) only sweetened the deal.

But of course, you need to have a backup plan. An original plan from [1995 required co-production capability within four years](http://www.spacepolitics.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/Mitchell_Report_May2014.pdf). However, that was early enough that there was still serious skepticism by the US on the part of the former Soviet Union.
Backup plans though, are extremely expensive. Maintaining co-production capability, even given four years to ramp it up, takes a significant amount of man power. Among other things, you need to pay to keep drawings, have engineers keep up proficiency, train incoming workers, and have long lead parts on hand. And you have to do this all for something that won't make money for your company. The government recognized this, and it soon approved a co-production extension (basically saying we'll allow the time you need to build an engine to be more than four years).

As years went on, relations with Russia warmed and the commercial launch industry sank. The costs of maintaining production were so high that the government agreed to remove the requirement altogether. In 2008, ["the decision was made to conclude the program \[of co-production\], partly because of the commercial market downturn. The resulting lower launch rate did not provide a robust business case for building a U.S. production facility.](http://forum.nasaspaceflight.com/index.php?PHPSESSID=bi1d2tl1lmgtq0ehdt8ff7f223&topic=14224.0;all)" The general idea was that Delta IV, combined with a US stockpile of RD-180 engines, would be enough to ride out any bumps in the supply chain.

Post-2008, it becomes pretty clear why ULA did not maintain immediate capability to build an RD-180. Supply of the engines was never really in doubt (even since Rogozin made his comments, [every engine has arrived on time](http://spacenews.com/41622ula-takes-delivery-of-two-rd-180-rocket-engines-from-russia/)) until we shot ourselves in the foot with the 2015 National Defense Authorization Act. (*Edit: Access was restored with the most recent omnibus spending bill*)

Now, even if this whole backstory didn't complicate the issue enough, the currently in force 2015 explicitly prohibits "[a contract for the procurement of property or services for space launch activities under the evolved expendable launch vehicle program if such contract carries out such space launch activities using rocket engines designed or manufactured in the Russian Federation](http://www.armed-services.senate.gov/imo/media/doc/CPRT-113-HPRT-RU00-S1847.pdf). [See page 844 - large PDF warning for people on mobile]".  A domestic RD-180 would still have been designed in Russia, eliminating it from use.
