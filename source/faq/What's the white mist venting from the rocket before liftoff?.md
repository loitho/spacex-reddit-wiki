# What's the white mist venting from the rocket before liftoff?

Prior to launch, the Falcon propellant tanks are filled with Kerosene and LOX (Liquid Oxygen). On F9v1.1 and earlier, the LOX was continuously boiling and evaporating, so they had the need to vent the invisible oxygen gas from the rocket. This gas is still very cold, and as it mixes with the ambient air, it dramatically cools it down. The air in Florida is humid, meaning it contains a lot of invisible gaseous water. As the warm humid air meets the freezing oxygen gas vented from the rocket, the atmospheric water turns from invisible gas into a visible liquid aerosol (also known as water vapor). This is what you're seeing.

With Falcon 9 v1.2, the LOX propellant is kept considerably more chilled to densify it, at temperatures of approximately -207°C (-340°F); and the RP-1 is kept at -7°C (20F).
