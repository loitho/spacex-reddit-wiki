# How do Falcon's landing legs work?

[Take a look at these diagrams.](https://imgur.com/a/JLbJ3) Concealed within each leg is a pneumatic piston. Just prior to landing, the piston is filled with high pressure helium gas, which increases its length. As it extends, the piston forces the leg to rotate downwards into the landing configuration.

Note that the landing legs are not retractable. Once the vehicle has landed, they must be manually removed; and restowed later.
