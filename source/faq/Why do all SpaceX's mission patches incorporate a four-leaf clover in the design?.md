# Why do all SpaceX's mission patches incorporate a four-leaf clover in the design?

Four leaf clovers are considered lucky in many western countries. SpaceX's love for clovers is a tradition that started in the early days of the company. After the first three Falcon 1 launches failed, by chance they put a four-leaf clover on the Falcon 1 Flight 4 patch. That launch was successful, so every subsequent mission has had a clover on it for luck.
