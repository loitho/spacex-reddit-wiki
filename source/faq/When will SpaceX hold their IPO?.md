# When will SpaceX hold their IPO?

SpaceX currently a private company, meaning that they are not publicly traded on any stock markets. In the future, it is likely that SpaceX will make an IPO (Initial Public Offering), and become publicly traded, but Elon has stated [that it won't happen until MCT is flying regularly](https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/342566837852200960). Given that this is at least 10, and probably 20 years away, the average person won't be able to buy shares any time soon.
