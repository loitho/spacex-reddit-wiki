# What is the blue Stargate-looking camera view shown during launch?

[This camera view](https://i.imgur.com/WRp2ujX.gifv) shows the inside of the second stage LOX tank. What you are looking at is Liquid Oxygen floating around in microgravity. LOX is a pale blue color whereas RP-1 is pale yellow, and the RP-1 tank has the the LOX transfer tube running through the center of it, whereas this tank doesn't. We know it's on the second stage because the liquid reacts to the microgravity of spaceflight at the same time the second stage's engines are cut off.
