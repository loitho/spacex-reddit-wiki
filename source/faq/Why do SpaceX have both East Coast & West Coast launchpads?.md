# Why do SpaceX have both East Coast and West Coast launchpads?

Orbital mechanics & current U.S. law requires it! There is a general aversion to flying over land as this creates risk to those in the flight path below you due to the possibility of a malfunction or vehicle breakup. Because of this, the vast majority of launches are conducted where the trajectory takes the vehicle over the ocean.

As a result, SpaceX uses their east coast launch sites to launch into low inclination orbits straddling the equator, such as Low Earth Orbit or Geostationary Transfer Orbit, by flying out over the Atlantic Ocean. They use their west coast launch site to launch into high inclination orbits, such as Polar Orbit, or Sun Synchronous Orbit, by flying south over the Pacific.
