# What is a Autonomous Spaceport Drone Ship (ASDS)?

The ASDS, or Autonomous Spaceport Drone Ship, is an ocean-going, barge-derived, floating landing platform used by SpaceX began as landing platforms for boosters recovery at sea. The original ASDS that has been used for all landing attempts in the first half of 2015 was the Marmac 300, which was named by Elon Musk as *Just Read The Instructions*. In mid 2015, Marmac 300 was returned to the owners (the barges are only rented), and SpaceX took delivery of Marmac 303 and Marmac 304. Marmac 304 is currently on the East Coast for catching stages launched from Cape Canaveral, Florida. This barge has been named *Of Course I Still Love You*. Marmac 303 was bought through the Panama Canal to the West Coast and moored at LA, in order to catch future stages launched from Vandenberg, California. This barge was again named *Just Read The Instructions*. The names are references to ships from the late Iain M. Banks' Culture novels.
