# Does SpaceX publish a testing schedule for McGregor, Texas?

There is no published public testing schedule for McGregor, although engines are tested almost daily. Occasionally the local news will publish a warning of an upcoming "louder than usual" test (usually a full nine-engine firing) roughly one day in advance, but no time for the test will be given. Additionally, SpaceX have no incentive to make such tests publicly visible as it may draw unwanted attention to any potential failures on the test stand.
