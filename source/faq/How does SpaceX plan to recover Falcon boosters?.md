# How does SpaceX plan to recover Falcon boosters?

There are two general methodologies that SpaceX use to recover boosters: either [Return To Launch Site (RTLS),](https://imgur.com/rWSpbWO) or landing at sea on the [Autonomous Spaceport Drone Ship (ASDS).](https://i.imgur.com/s61bv2t.jpg)

For RTLS, after stage separation, SpaceX rotates the first stage so that the engines are facing in the direction that the booster is flying. Three engines relight, burning to slowing the stage down to a halt and reversing its trajectory to carry it back to the launch site. This is known as the *boostback burn*. After the boostback burn is complete, the four grid fins deploy; they are used to guide the booster through the hypersonic region of the atmospheric reentry. Then, immediately before reentry, the three engines ignite again so the booster can reenter the atmosphere at a safe speed. This is known as the *reentry burn*. After the reentry burn has completed and the booster is within the atmosphere, the stage will continue to fall under gravity, slowing the whole time due to air resistance, until it is at terminal velocity (the fastest speed it will reach, due to the opposing forces of gravity and aerodynamic drag). A few hundred meters above the surface of the landing zone, the single center engine will reignite again to slow the booster to a stop, aiming to reach zero meters per second at the exact point that the altitude reaches zero. The booster cannot hover; this is because the thrust from even a single Merlin engine, throttled down to its minimum thrust of 70%, is greater than the weight of the booster. When landing on the ASDS, everything is the same, except they omit the boostback burn so as to land downrange.
