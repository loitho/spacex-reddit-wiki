# When we get an update on [topic]? I want more information!

SpaceX are generous in how much they share with the public: for example, within minutes of the CRS-7 disaster, Elon Musk shared several detailed, technical updates on Twitter. Not many companies behave in this way. However, experience this for long enough, and it is easy to grow accustomed to it, and even grow to *expect* updates. When SpaceX choose to hold their cards closer to their chest, that is well within their rights as a private company. Feeding the curiosity of non-client fans has to be low in their list of priorities.
