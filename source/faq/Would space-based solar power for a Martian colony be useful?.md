# Would space-based solar power for a Martian colony be useful?

Orbital solar arrays have been proposed in the past to get around the problem of efficiency losses due to atmospheric scattering on Earth. On Mars, solar panels would also have to deal with dust deposition. However, Elon Musk has been firm in his opposition to space-based solar power: since a solar array would have to first convert photons (from the sun) into electrons (electricity), then convert that electricity into microwave power for transmission to the ground (photons again), then on the ground convert those photons back into electricity, that means that the extra conversions would wipe out even a two-fold increase in incident solar power that could be achieved by putting the panels in orbit. Add on the fact that it costs money and energy to put things into orbit, and [it simply "super-doesn't work"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gVgM2BlMczY#t=41m55s). Unless solar panels in space are able to put out many times the energy of solar panels on Mars, it doesn't make sense to put them in orbit.
