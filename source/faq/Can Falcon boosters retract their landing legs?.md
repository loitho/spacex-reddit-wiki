# Can Falcon boosters retract their landing legs?

No. The mechanism to deploy the landing legs is one-way, utilizing helium to extend them. Once they deploy fully, retracting them is relatively complex. Because of the complexity, SpaceX removes the landing legs rather than stowing them directly. This was demonstrated after the Orbcomm OG-2 Launch 2 with the recovered core.
