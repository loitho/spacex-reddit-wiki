# What are the differences between Falcon 9 v1.1 and the upgraded Falcon version popularly called the v1.2?

In March 2015, [Elon Musk tweeted](https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/572257004938403840) about a series of 3 upgrades planned for the F9v1.1: 1) Increasing the available thrust of the M1D engines ~15%.  2) Subchilling the propellants, which increases their densities--allowing more to be loaded in the same volume.  3) Increasing the volume of the upper stage by 10%.  Though it is currently unknown what SpaceX will choose to officially call it, when taken together, a Falcon 9 that includes all three changes is popularly referred to as v1.2.  The switch to the new version may also include other small changes/modifications as yet unannounced by SpaceX.

The cumulative effect of the changes is to [increase F9 performance ~30%](https://twitter.com/pbdes/status/577879010262188033) and thereby allow recovery of boosters even on heavy GTO launches. On F9v1.1 launches, these high-energy flight profiles require too much performance to be able to recover boosters. SpaceX launched the first F9v1.2 in December 2015, carrying the OG2-2 satellites to Low Earth Orbit.
