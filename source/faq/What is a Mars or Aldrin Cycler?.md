# What is a Mars or Aldrin Cycler?

Aldrin Cyclers are spacecraft permanently on a heliocentric orbit that intersect the orbits of both Mars and Earth. If you're launching from Earth to Mars, you're following a defined path between the two bodies - so why not stick a very large spacecraft on that known path way, which you can dock with and inhabit on the way?

Aldrin Cyclers are not on a circular orbit between the two planets; by definition, they're on an eccentric orbit that takes them close to both planets on a regular basis. Many different orbits would work - you could have low energy Cyclers that follow a Hohmann transfer orbit for a ~6 month travel time, or very eccentric, energetic Cyclers that give you transfer times as low as 1 month (the downside to these is that they spend most of their orbit far from Mars or Earth, so you're need lots of them for regular transfers - plus any docking spacecraft would have to accelerate to and decelerate from those very high velocities as well).

Cyclers never enter Mars orbit or Earth orbit, they just continuously cycle back and forth (hence the name) between the edges of the SOI of the two planets. They would require some fuel to keep station around their orbit, but they wouldn't ever burn to help a spacecraft transit between the two planets. Cyclers are more like "passive" artificial asteroids just built for habitation, nothing else.
