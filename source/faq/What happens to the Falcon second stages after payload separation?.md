# What happens to the Falcon second stages after payload separation?

The second stages are left in orbit until they decay, or, as of more recently, deliberately deorbited if in Low Earth Orbit to reduce orbital debris, as was done on the CRS-3 & CRS-4 missions. Previous stages have used the former approach or have been boosted into higher orbits for a variety of reasons (such as testing the second stage engine's relight capability). For missions where the Falcon upper stage is injected into GTO, such as SES-8 & Thaicom 6, they are left in these orbits, as the perigee (usually around 180-300km) is low enough that drag will remove the stage from orbit after 2-12 months.
