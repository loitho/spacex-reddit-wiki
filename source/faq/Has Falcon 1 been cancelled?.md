# Has Falcon 1 been cancelled?

The Falcon 1 (and its proposed successor, the Falcon 1e) has likely been cancelled. There is a possibility that they might be resurrected if demand is there, but, as Wikipedia states: "SpaceX had announced an enhanced variant, the Falcon 1e, but as of May 2012, SpaceX states that 'Current plans are for payloads that would fly on Falcon 1 to be served by flights on the Falcon 9, utilizing excess capacity' and no Falcon 1 or 1e flights are scheduled through 2017." In addition to this, Falcon 1 is no longer listed on SpaceX's website.
