# What sort of jobs are available at SpaceX?

SpaceX are a large and growing aerospace company with a huge variety positions  available. The highest profile jobs are the engineering corps, who design and refine the systems and architectures required for successful spaceflight. But if you don't have a head for engineering, there is still a place for everyone at SpaceX. The factory floor is manned by hundreds of machinists and technicians who actually build the equipment that flies to orbit. SpaceX also need people to fill their HR, PR, QA, sales, legal and finance departments. If you don't like the idea of working in a factory in LA, there are opportunities to work at the launch pads or the R&D centers.
