# Why does SpaceX sometimes land on the ASDS when they could land back at the pad?

Initially, barge landings were about safety, and were used for practice before moving towards landing back at the launch site. However, even though RTLS has now been proven to work, the booster cannot always land at the launch site. The main practical difference is that RTLS trajectory consumes more fuel than ASDS, which eats into the payload capability. RTLS loses about 30% total capacity, vs about 15% for ASDS landings. Barge landings are needed for high mass / high velocity launches, such as Geostationary Transfer Orbit missions. During these types of missions, it's just not physically possible to return to launch site. This is because they put such a high demand on the rocket; the rocket needs to work hard to raise a heavy bird to the speeds required for high orbits. To land back at the pad, speed at stage separation cannot be greater than about 6000 km/hr. If you can land on a ship, there's no need to zero out the booster's lateral velocity, so stage separation can occur at up to around 9000 km/h. Put another way, the extra âˆ†V "boost back" expense inflicts a penalty on payload mass.
