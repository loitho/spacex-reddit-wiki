# How is SpaceX funded? What are the sources of their income?

SpaceX was founded initially using capital from private investors, including $100 million from Elon Musk, and a further $100 million through other private investors, such as Fisher Draper Jurvetson. Over time, more money came in through commercial activities. By 2012, SpaceX had over 40 launches on its manifest representing about $4 billion in contract revenue. Many of these are purely commercial launches for non-government organizations, such as global telecommunication companies, but SpaceX's biggest customer by value of contracts is NASA. NASA has two primary contracts with SpaceX, both concerned with the International Space Station; the Commercial Resupply Contract, worth $1.6 billion, and Commercial Crew Transportation Capability, worth $2.6 billion.
