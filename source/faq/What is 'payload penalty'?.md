# What is 'payload penalty'?

All of the structures and propellants required for landing the booster takes away from the payload capacity, due to the fact that they take up mass that would normally be carried to orbit. This effect is much worse for the second stage than it is for the first stage: every kilogram of reusability equipment on the second stage eats up one kilogram of the payload; this ratio is much lower (around 10%? **fact check needed**) for the first stage. Some attempt to lessen the amount of fuel needed to boostback is made by flying a more vertical trajectory on the ascent, with lower lateral velocity and hence lower the fuel needed to boostback. This does however result in a slightly less efficient orbital insertion.
