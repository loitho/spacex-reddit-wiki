# What just fell off the second stage engine bell?

[That is the second stage engine nozzle stiffener ring](http://www.spacex.com/files/assets/img/20100618_F91_14.jpg). The bell nozzle on the MVac engine is not very rigid (this is for a variety of reasons, most importantly are weight savings, and ensuring good thermal radiative properties to keep it cool), especially when the engine is not firing. The ring keeps the nozzle from flexing too much during the first stage burn. After the MVac is ignited, the positive pressure from the engine firing pushes on the inside of the nozzle which prevents it from flexing, so the stabilizer ring is no longer needed. It breaks off and falls away, as it is designed to do.
