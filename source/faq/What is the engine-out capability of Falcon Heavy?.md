# What is the engine-out capability of Falcon Heavy?

It's unlikely you can simplify such a complicated system down to a single 'engine out' rule with Falcon Heavy. It's already reasonably complicated with Falcon 9 (two engine failures must occur at optimum times for this to be possible), but two additional cores makes it impossible to calculate without having detailed access to Falcon Heavy's design. There'd likely be dozens of multiple scenarios for engine-out events dependent on when the engine fails, which engine failed, and what payload mass is being carried.
