# What might the Martian habitats look like?

At first, colonists would be living out of the BFS on which they arrived. More 'lander can' style habitats would follow, perhaps landed in the same area to form a small 'town' of habitation modules. Ultimately though, colonists would have to learn to live off the land, and use the resources available to them to build habitats of their own.

Roman vaults could be built out of Martian bricks. Mars has everything you need to make bricks, and Roman vaults are incredibly strong and roomy load-bearing structures. Pile dust and dirt on top, and you have radiation shielding. If you model the atmosphere of the Martian hab after than of Skylab (3.5 psi oxygen, 1.5 psi nitrogen), the vaults experience 3.5 tonne per square metre force trying to explode the structure upwards; a layer of dirt 3 metres thick will be more than enough to contain that. This structure would leak air, but slowly due to the mass of compressed material it has to escape through. Spray the internal surface with some sort of epoxy resin, and you slow the loss dramatically. Furthermore, any leaks should be self sealing, as the warm humid internal air leaks out into the cold soil, it forms leak-blocking permafrost to form in the diffusion paths though the soil roof.
