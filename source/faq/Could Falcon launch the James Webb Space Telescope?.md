# Could Falcon launch the James Webb Space Telescope?

No. Even if there wasn't a launch vehicle already scheduled for the infrared successor to Hubble (there is: Ariane 5 is contracted to launch it in 2018 - a rocket with 50+ consecutive mission successes), it's far too heavy at 6200kg for Falcon 9 to place it towards its destination at Sun-Earth L2. What about Falcon Heavy? A Falcon Heavy likely could place it where it needs to be (expendable payload to Mars of FH is 13,200kg), but NASA will not entrust a rocket that will have by 2017 launched only two or three times with their cutting-edge $8.5 billion decadal flagship science mission.

If you've already spend that much, what's another $100m to launch on a rocket with a reliable record? Rocket failures have doomed a number of NASA science satellites as of late (Glory & Orbiting Carbon Observatory) and as such they are under scrutiny to be sure their missions succeed.
