# What patents do SpaceX hold? Would they consider releasing them like Tesla Motors did?

SpaceX are in a unique situation in this regard. They generally don't bother with patents as they are worthless against the competition (federal governments). Musk stated in an interview to [Wired](http://www.wired.com/2012/10/ff-elon-musk-qa/all/): "We have essentially no patents in SpaceX. Our primary long-term competition is in Chinaâ€”if we published patents, it would be farcical, because the Chinese would just use them as a recipe book.".

Saying this, there is at least one public SpaceX patent: "[US7503511 Pintle injector tip with active cooling](https://www.google.com/patents/US7503511)". The assignee is listed as Space Exploration Technologies, but the credited inventor is Tom Mueller (VP of Propulsion), however, it was filed for in 2005, so such a patent was likely filed as part of a condition of Mueller's employment. Even if they decided they wanted to release their technology to the public, they would be barred from doing so as much of it is protected by ITAR.
