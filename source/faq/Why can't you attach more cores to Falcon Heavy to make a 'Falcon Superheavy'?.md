# Why can't you attach more cores to Falcon Heavy to make a 'Falcon Superheavy'?

Because the downsides outweigh the positives. The only advantage is a slightly higher payload. While this seems like a good idea, adding more cores gets even more complex and provides even less benefit. Adding two cores to a single-stick Falcon 9 increases the acceleration at launch, increasing the payload. But with another two cores, this effect is even smaller. And since fuel crossfeed has been dropped due to complexity, KSP-like asparagus staging isn't possible. There is also the possibility of the payload not fitting into the 5-meter fairing. Possibly the most significant difficulty is that the rocket no longer sits flat on its side. This might seem unimportant, but having the rocket sit all on one level makes integration much easier. SpaceX would need new equipment to assemble the rocket, and this equipment would only be used on the occasional Falcon Superheavy launch. Finally, this makes reuse even more tricky. Because either there will be three core separation events, or four cores landing at once. Comparing the minor benefits with the major difficulties, a Falcon Superheavy isn't practical enough for SpaceX to pursue.
