# Watching a Launch

## I'll be near a launch site soon. What are the chances of getting to see the launch?

The answer to this depends on how long until the launch is scheduled. SpaceX is still a relatively young spaceflight company, and have still not yet established a reliable launch cadence and are occasionally subject to delays. That said, all rocket launches experience delays to some degree (spaceflight is hard), *so do not plan your travels around rocket launches!*

## I'm at Boca Chica. Where's the best place to watch the launch?



## I'm at Cape Canaveral. Where's the best place to watch the launch?

Falcon 9 rockets launch from SLC-40 at Cape Canaveral [(map)](https://goo.gl/LwgvdR). [Here is a map image](http://i.imgur.com/NEWAKIM.jpg) of some of the available options. Yellow sites indicate restricted access.

This is a very frequently asked question. See [here](http://redd.it/1zxt5z), [here](http://redd.it/1kzcb0), [here](http://redd.it/21cubj), [here](http://redd.it/1ztq4e), and [here](http://redd.it/1z1lna) for more discussion.

Early and late launches may make some of these sites not available. Availability may be limited and KSC may open certain cites on certain launches. *It pays to check beforehand if the site will be open.*

Another good resource is [launchphotography.com](http://www.launchphotography.com/Delta_4_Atlas_5_Falcon_9_Launch_Viewing.html) Scroll down to Section 2.

Returning rockets land at Landing Complex 1 [(map)](https://goo.gl/DETftl). This facility is located south and east of the SLC-40 launch site.
You will get a much better view outside KSC if you bring binoculars.

## I'm at Vandenberg. Where's the best place to watch the launch?

Falcon flies less frequently from Vandenberg Air Force Base than it does from the East Coast, but there's still a lot of interest in watching the launches. See [here](http://redd.it/1kzcb0/) and [here](https://redd.it/3zllm9) for discussion about how to watch the launch. See [here](https://redd.it/415ppz) for tips on viewing by a former staffer at the launch site.

SpaceX launch from [Space Launch Complex 4 East (SLC-4E)](https://goo.gl/EnxH8E). Viewing rocket launches from Vandenberg AFB can be tricky, as the entire base is closed off for non-military personnel at all times. You're going to have to stick to public roads. Rockets fly in a southern direction going out over the Channel Islands, and the launch pads are in a hilly area which partially blocks the view. On most days there is a marine overcast layer, which rolls out in the morning and back in the afternoon, and on some days it can be foggy.

The best place to watch launches from SLC-4E is at [Surf Beach](https://goo.gl/GcizOT), if the Sheriff does not close access to the beach. If it is closed there will be two police cars on Ocean Road just past 13th street; the closest you can then get is the [parking lot](https://goo.gl/y39xJI) at the western extreme of Ocean Road. Getting there early is essential, as the parking lot is very small, the road is narrow and parking along the side of the road is often limited. If Surf Beach is closed or Ocean Road is over-crowded, the best alternatives are [Renwick Road](https://goo.gl/Hhro7R) (the hills will block the view until it gets about a half mile up) or [Harris Grade Road](https://goo.gl/BmLP7s) (you'll be higher up so you'll see it sooner, but you'll be further away).

## I'm online. Where can I watch the launch, what streams should I watch, and how can I participate in the discussion?

Yes! [r/SpaceX](http://reddit.com/r/spacex) hosts a regular "launch discussion and updates" thread for each SpaceX launch. You can freely comment and participate however you like, with relaxed subreddit rules. This thread is stickied to the top of the subreddit about 2-3 days before and after a launch. After launch, and to receive more technically-detailed updates, follow along on Twitter using our list of useful Twitter accounts on the [resources page](http://www.reddit.com/r/spacex/wiki/resources). Additionally there is an r/SpaceX IRC channel which you can [join here](https://kiwiirc.com/client/irc.esper.net/#SpaceX).

You can watch the launch live from a number of different locations:

* [SpaceX on YouTube (Hosted + Technical Webcasts)](https://www.youtube.com/user/spacexchannel)

* [r/SpaceX Live](https://rspacex.com/live) contains all the available streams to watch in a multitude of formats, with streaming text updates from the moderators and from Twitter.

* [SpaceX.com (YouTube Hosted Webcast)](http://spacex.com/webcast)

* NASA, NOAA, & DoD payload launches are also streamed on [NASA TV](http://www.nasa.gov/multimedia/nasatv/)

SpaceX hosts two webcasts on YouTube; the **hosted webcast** and the **technical webcast**. If you are new to rocketry or SpaceX, and would like a more guided experience with explanations about what is happening, be sure to watch the hosted webcast. For enthusiasts who would rather listen in to the launch loop communications and watch the rocket without the newscasters, choose the technical webcast. SpaceX webcasts usually go live roughly 20-30 minutes before liftoff - please note the countdown timer on the YouTube webcasts counts down to the *launch*, not the webcast beginning. NASA TV usually begin 1-2 hours before launch if it is a NASA-managed launch, and will not feature SpaceX hosted commentary. If you experience problems getting a steady stream try selecting a lower quality or bitrate.
