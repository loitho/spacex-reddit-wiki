# Orbits & Rocketry

## What determines the launch window length? Why are some instantaneous or only 1 second long?



## What is 'payload penalty'?

All of the structures and propellants required for landing the booster takes away from the payload capacity, due to the fact that they take up mass that would normally be carried to orbit. This effect is much worse for the second stage than it is for the first stage: every kilogram of reusability equipment on the second stage eats up one kilogram of the payload; this ratio is much lower (around 10%? **fact check needed**) for the first stage. Some attempt to lessen the amount of fuel needed to boostback is made by flying a more vertical trajectory on the ascent, with lower lateral velocity and hence lower the fuel needed to boostback. This does however result in a slightly less efficient orbital insertion.

## What is a Mars or Aldrin Cycler?

Aldrin Cyclers are spacecraft permanently on a heliocentric orbit that intersect the orbits of both Mars and Earth. If you're launching from Earth to Mars, you're following a defined path between the two bodies - so why not stick a very large spacecraft on that known path way, which you can dock with and inhabit on the way?

Aldrin Cyclers are not on a circular orbit between the two planets; by definition, they're on an eccentric orbit that takes them close to both planets on a regular basis. Many different orbits would work - you could have low energy Cyclers that follow a Hohmann transfer orbit for a ~6 month travel time, or very eccentric, energetic Cyclers that give you transfer times as low as 1 month (the downside to these is that they spend most of their orbit far from Mars or Earth, so you're need lots of them for regular transfers - plus any docking spacecraft would have to accelerate to and decelerate from those very high velocities as well).

Cyclers never enter Mars orbit or Earth orbit, they just continuously cycle back and forth (hence the name) between the edges of the SOI of the two planets. They would require some fuel to keep station around their orbit, but they wouldn't ever burn to help a spacecraft transit between the two planets. Cyclers are more like "passive" artificial asteroids just built for habitation, nothing else.

## Why does SpaceX sometimes land on the ASDS when they could land back at the pad?

Initially, barge landings were about safety, and were used for practice before moving towards landing back at the launch site. However, even though RTLS has now been proven to work, the booster cannot always land at the launch site. The main practical difference is that RTLS trajectory consumes more fuel than ASDS, which eats into the payload capability. RTLS loses about 30% total capacity, vs about 15% for ASDS landings. Barge landings are needed for high mass / high velocity launches, such as Geostationary Transfer Orbit missions. During these types of missions, it's just not physically possible to return to launch site. This is because they put such a high demand on the rocket; the rocket needs to work hard to raise a heavy bird to the speeds required for high orbits. To land back at the pad, speed at stage separation cannot be greater than about 6000 km/hr. If you can land on a ship, there's no need to zero out the booster's lateral velocity, so stage separation can occur at up to around 9000 km/h. Put another way, the extra âˆ†V "boost back" expense inflicts a penalty on payload mass.

## Why is Helium so difficult to work with?
