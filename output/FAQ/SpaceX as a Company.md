# SpaceX as a Company

## What is ITAR?

ITAR is the [International Traffic in Arms Regulations](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Traffic_in_Arms_Regulations), which control export and import of defense-related articles on the United States Munitions List.  As it applies to SpaceX, it means that SpaceX cannot disclose any specific information that would aid a foreign national in building a rocket, that includes satellite providers. This has the side effect of meaning that SpaceX cannot land their rockets on foreign soil, preventing a downrange landing in the Caribbean for a Cape Canaveral launch, for example.

## Does SpaceX have any operations outside of the United States?

Because of ITAR limitations, SpaceX is unlikely to have any operations outside the U.S. for the foreseeable future. It is possible they might create a sister company that develops things not subject to ITAR at some point, but the vertically integrated nature of SpaceX makes this unlikely.

## Does SpaceX publish a testing schedule for McGregor, Texas?

There is no published public testing schedule for McGregor, although engines are tested almost daily. Occasionally the local news will publish a warning of an upcoming "louder than usual" test (usually a full nine-engine firing) roughly one day in advance, but no time for the test will be given. Additionally, SpaceX have no incentive to make such tests publicly visible as it may draw unwanted attention to any potential failures on the test stand.

## How can I get a tour at SpaceX?

Tours aren't open to the general public, and you can only get one if you are personally invited by a SpaceX employee; or have NASA or Air Force accreditation. However, please **do not request invites** from the employees who browse here, as it annoys them, and there's too much potential for it to go wrong. In order to visit SpaceX property, you have to be a US person (Citizen, Naturalized Citizen, or LPR) due to ITAR requirements (though exceptions have been made). However, everyone is welcome to watch the following video tours of the [Hawthorne factory](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TQ6tZtGrShg), the [McGregor test site,](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bdvv8qIl_WI) and the [Cape Canaveral launch site.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_FlhbMraqxA)

## How can I support SpaceX financially?

The easiest way to support SpaceX monetarily is to purchase from their [online store](http://shop.spacex.com/), which can also help to advertise them and boost their brand visibility. As shares in the company are not for sale (unless you are a venture capitalist, with significant resources to invest), and they do not accept donations, it's difficult to directly invest. It is possible to *indirectly* invest in SpaceX, by buying shares in one of their investors, but exactly how much of this money will actually end up in SpaceX is anyone's guess.

## How can I support SpaceX politically?

If you live in the United States, you can contact elected officials and tell them how much you support NASA's commercial space program. [This link](http://www.senate.gov/reference/common/faq/How_to_contact_senators.htm) explains how to contact your Senator, and [this link](http://www.usa.gov/Contact/US-Congress.shtml) explains how to contact your Representative. Politicians will always be interested to hear the opinions of the electorate who keep them in office, and they'll be keen to support commercial space if they know that's what the people want. Happy lobbying!

## How is SpaceX funded? What are the sources of their income?

SpaceX was founded initially using capital from private investors, including $100 million from Elon Musk, and a further $100 million through other private investors, such as Fisher Draper Jurvetson. Over time, more money came in through commercial activities. By 2012, SpaceX had over 40 launches on its manifest representing about $4 billion in contract revenue. Many of these are purely commercial launches for non-government organizations, such as global telecommunication companies, but SpaceX's biggest customer by value of contracts is NASA. NASA has two primary contracts with SpaceX, both concerned with the International Space Station; the Commercial Resupply Contract, worth $1.6 billion, and Commercial Crew Transportation Capability, worth $2.6 billion.

## How much does a launch scrub cost SpaceX?

It's obviously not possible to come up with a fixed value for such a relatively unique event (as obviously a scrub where they launch the following day would be cheaper than a scrub where they need to bring the rocket back to horizontal and check it over), but we can estimate the costs that SpaceX would incur. Everyone at SpaceX is likely salaried, and the pad crew (who may or may not actually qualify as a salaried job) probably are too. So the overtime to be paid is likely minimal. They have to pay the Air Force to do launches from CCAFS, but only they and the AF know how that is structured and what a scrub costs. There's probably a fixed cost for reconfiguring the range for another launch if the delay is long enough that someone else launches between attempts. If they get to pressurization then they are likely losing a lot of helium, which is more expensive than the entire load of LOX. In addition, recovery assets also need to be paid. Fuel for a big ship is not cheap to go out a few hundred miles and return.

## Is there any chance SpaceX may provide or sell its engines to other companies in the future?

It is unlikely for a number of reasons, predominantly, SpaceX have patented very few parts of their engines out of concern that governments and other companies may get hold of the specifics. SpaceX are also more about selling services rather than components.

## What components do SpaceX not produce in-house?

[See this interesting thread from May 2014](http://redd.it/24o5pf) for more details. Objects such as Dragon's ECLSS, some equipment (for thermal analysis), and sheet metal for parts are all sourced out of the company. The Merlin engine turbopumps used to be produced by Barber-Nichols, but these were eventually brought in-house for the Merlin-1D.

## Does SpaceX manage this subreddit?

No. This community is 100% run by fans, for fans. No posts or comments should ever be construed as official SpaceX statements, unless they have come from a verified, flaired user who is making an official SpaceX statement. For official SpaceX news, please visit spacex.com.

Note that occasionally we will, provided we are given a legitimate request, remove content from this subreddit at request of third parties. This is done to ensure a good working relationship with these third parties.

## What patents do SpaceX hold? Would they consider releasing them like Tesla Motors did?

SpaceX are in a unique situation in this regard. They generally don't bother with patents as they are worthless against the competition (federal governments). Musk stated in an interview to [Wired](http://www.wired.com/2012/10/ff-elon-musk-qa/all/): "We have essentially no patents in SpaceX. Our primary long-term competition is in Chinaâ€”if we published patents, it would be farcical, because the Chinese would just use them as a recipe book.".

Saying this, there is at least one public SpaceX patent: "[US7503511 Pintle injector tip with active cooling](https://www.google.com/patents/US7503511)". The assignee is listed as Space Exploration Technologies, but the credited inventor is Tom Mueller (VP of Propulsion), however, it was filed for in 2005, so such a patent was likely filed as part of a condition of Mueller's employment. Even if they decided they wanted to release their technology to the public, they would be barred from doing so as much of it is protected by ITAR.

## When we get an update on [topic]? I want more information!

SpaceX are generous in how much they share with the public: for example, within minutes of the CRS-7 disaster, Elon Musk shared several detailed, technical updates on Twitter. Not many companies behave in this way. However, experience this for long enough, and it is easy to grow accustomed to it, and even grow to *expect* updates. When SpaceX choose to hold their cards closer to their chest, that is well within their rights as a private company. Feeding the curiosity of non-client fans has to be low in their list of priorities.

## When will SpaceX hold their IPO?

SpaceX currently a private company, meaning that they are not publicly traded on any stock markets. In the future, it is likely that SpaceX will make an IPO (Initial Public Offering), and become publicly traded, but Elon has stated [that it won't happen until MCT is flying regularly](https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/342566837852200960). Given that this is at least 10, and probably 20 years away, the average person won't be able to buy shares any time soon.

## When will SpaceX release the mission patch for [next upcoming mission]?

Please be patient. SpaceX typically release the mission patch as a part of the mission press kit, which is typically release only a few days before the launch. As soon as we see the patch has been released, it will be used on the subreddit.

## Who are the key employees of SpaceX?

SpaceX currently has over 4000 employees, but many of the senior staff are well known around the spaceflight industry. **Elon Musk** is CEO and Chief Designer of the company, and oversees all major company decisions. **Gwynne Shotwell** is the company president and COO (Chief Operating Officer) and "is responsible for day-to-day operations and for managing all customer and strategic relations to support company growth". **Tom Mueller** is VP of Propulsion and designer of the Merlin 1C & 1D engine, along with Raptor - he is considered one of the leading propulsion experts in the world and is one of the founding employees of the company.

Other employees include **John Taylor** (@jbtaylor) who is Director of Communications, **Hans Koenigsmann** is VP of Mission Assurance (and can often be seen at CRS conferences), **Garrett Reisman** is the Dragon v2 Product Lead (and former NASA astronaut), **John Insprucker** is the Falcon 9 Product Director and webcast host, **Molly McCormick** (@Molliway) is working on spacesuit design.

Also on the board of Directors is **Kimbal Musk** (Elon's brother), and **Steve Jurvetson**, well known Silicon Valley and newspace entrepreneur.

## Why did Elon Musk found SpaceX?

Elon Musk founded SpaceX out of frustration with the slow technological development pace of human spaceflight. After trying to negotiate a launch with the purpose of landing a "greenhouse" on Mars in order to reinvigorate NASA, Musk quickly realised that the reason for slow progress was no lack of will, but the extraordinarily high cost of putting something - anything - into orbit.

The primary aim of SpaceX from the outset was to build a simple and relatively inexpensive reusable rocket system that could go into space multiple times, with a similar turn-around time capabilities that commercial airliners currently exhibit. By enabling cheap and easy access to space, the idea is that this will enable humans to settle other planets, and become a multi-planet species.

## Why do all SpaceX's mission patches incorporate a four-leaf clover in the design?

Four leaf clovers are considered lucky in many western countries. SpaceX's love for clovers is a tradition that started in the early days of the company. After the first three Falcon 1 launches failed, by chance they put a four-leaf clover on the Falcon 1 Flight 4 patch. That launch was successful, so every subsequent mission has had a clover on it for luck.

## Why is SpaceX interested in Mars and not the Moon?
