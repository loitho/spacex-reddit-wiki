# Falcon

## How is the distance to the ground measured from Falcon or Dragon 2?



## Are Falcon's booster landing legs reusable?



## Can Falcon 9 cores be used as Falcon Heavy cores and vice versa?



## Can Falcon boosters retract their landing legs?

No. The mechanism to deploy the landing legs is one-way, utilizing helium to extend them. Once they deploy fully, retracting them is relatively complex. Because of the complexity, SpaceX removes the landing legs rather than stowing them directly. This was demonstrated after the Orbcomm OG-2 Launch 2 with the recovered core.

## Can Falcon launch from Texas and land in Florida?

No. Elon Musk on Twitter stated: ["Side boosters fall short &amp;amp; center core goes too far + Florida is heavily populated. Landing permission tricky :)"](https://www.twitter.com/elonmusk/status/330395232564826112).

For a Falcon Heavy, the side boosters separate too early to easily travel to the cape. And the center core separates too late. And the larger issue comes in that flying a rocket stage on a ballistic trajectory over populated areas is too dangerous. Whereas a rocket launching from the Cape only travels over land [at the last second](https://i.imgur.com/Z81NgAk.png) (credit u/zlsa), a rocket launching from Texas would have to travel all the way across Florida.

## Can Falcon's landing legs be used for aerobraking?



## Could Falcon launch the James Webb Space Telescope?

No. Even if there wasn't a launch vehicle already scheduled for the infrared successor to Hubble (there is: Ariane 5 is contracted to launch it in 2018 - a rocket with 50+ consecutive mission successes), it's far too heavy at 6200kg for Falcon 9 to place it towards its destination at Sun-Earth L2. What about Falcon Heavy? A Falcon Heavy likely could place it where it needs to be (expendable payload to Mars of FH is 13,200kg), but NASA will not entrust a rocket that will have by 2017 launched only two or three times with their cutting-edge $8.5 billion decadal flagship science mission.

If you've already spend that much, what's another $100m to launch on a rocket with a reliable record? Rocket failures have doomed a number of NASA science satellites as of late (Glory & Orbiting Carbon Observatory) and as such they are under scrutiny to be sure their missions succeed.

## Could Falcon launch the Mars 2020 Rover?

For all intents and purposes, no. Falcon 9 does not have the capacity to deliver the required payload towards Mars (nearly 4000kg), thus does not have the ability to do so. Falcon Heavy could, but will not have flown enough missions by 2020 for it to be considered a reliable launch vehicle in NASA's eyes, and would also have to be 'nuclear rated' to carry the rovers Radioisotope Thermoelectric Generator (RTG) that provides it with power. Saying all this is relatively moot however; Mars 2020 it is preliminarily scheduled to fly on an Atlas V (which achieves 8 tons to GTO). See this NASA PDF for more details about [MSL/Mars 2020](http://solarsystem.nasa.gov/docs/MSL_Landing_20120724.pdf).

## Falcon sometimes topples over after landing. Would it help to add wires that could quickly support it, or cushions for it to fall on?

The Falcon booster is over 40 meters tall (as tall as a 13 story building), and weighs approximately 20 tonnes. Any structure 'catching' the booster would need to close very rapidly, and so the forces involved in manipulating an object of this size are huge. The rocket body is as thin as a scaled up coke can, and not designed to handle sidewards forces. In addition, the 'catching structure' would need to be very far out to avoid getting caught on the legs as they came down, particularly if the rocket was off center.

The trouble with surrounding the pad with a soft surface for the booster to fall onto is it'll need to be very close to where the booster lands, and it won't be able to land directly on the soft surface. As a result of this, it dramatically shrinks the possible landing area, making a botched landing all that more likely. In addition, the fragile booster likely won't survive falling on its side, no matter how soft the landing.

We know it's fun to think about ways to fix a problem, but this is a problem that is easily fixed by improving the robustness of the current system, so that everything works as designed. SpaceX's goal is to develop the technology needed to land on other surfaces than the earth, where there will be no pre-built landing support systems.

## Has Falcon 1 been cancelled?

The Falcon 1 (and its proposed successor, the Falcon 1e) has likely been cancelled. There is a possibility that they might be resurrected if demand is there, but, as Wikipedia states: "SpaceX had announced an enhanced variant, the Falcon 1e, but as of May 2012, SpaceX states that 'Current plans are for payloads that would fly on Falcon 1 to be served by flights on the Falcon 9, utilizing excess capacity' and no Falcon 1 or 1e flights are scheduled through 2017." In addition to this, Falcon 1 is no longer listed on SpaceX's website.

## How do Falcon's grid fins work?

Grid fins are a type of flight control surface. Conventional planar control fins are shaped like miniature wings, whereas grid fins are instead a lattice of smaller aerodynamic surfaces arranged within a box. Grid fins perform very well at subsonic and supersonic speeds, though poorly at transonic speeds. However, at high Mach numbers, grid fins flow fully supersonic and can provide lower drag and greater maneuverability than planar fins. See [this article](http://www.aerospaceweb.org/question/weapons/q0261.shtml) for a full explanation of their operation. Falcon has four of these fins, attached just above the LOX tank at the bottom of the interstage, at 90 degree angles to each other.

The grid fins have undergone redesigns since first being used, including different geometries and fabrication methods.

## How do Falcon's landing legs work?

[Take a look at these diagrams.](https://imgur.com/a/JLbJ3) Concealed within each leg is a pneumatic piston. Just prior to landing, the piston is filled with high pressure helium gas, which increases its length. As it extends, the piston forces the leg to rotate downwards into the landing configuration.

Note that the landing legs are not retractable. Once the vehicle has landed, they must be manually removed; and restowed later.

## How does Falcon's flight termination system work?

All Falcon rockets have a termination system in the case that an anomalous event is detected. The typical use case for flight termination is when the rocket's instantaneous impact point (IIP) strays outside of some predetermined corridor. The range continuously calculates an IIP during flight, which predicts where the vehicle will impact were thrust to be immediately terminated. If there is a guidance or propulsion failure that prevents the vehicle from being able to reach orbit, the range can terminate pre-emptively to keep the debris in a more controlled area. The termination system Falcon possesses is a cord-like explosive charge that goes down the side of the rocket. It doesn't "blow it up" but rather "unzips" it lengthwise. Following, the rocket disintegrates itself after that and the fuel blows up.

## How does the first stage of Falcon return to launch site?



## How fast is Falcon going when it reaches Max-Q?



## At what time does the landing occur?



## What are the differences between Falcon 9 v1.0 and v1.1?

As of Flight 6 (CASSIOPE) in September 2013, the Falcon 9 moved to version 1.1, which completely replaced the older v1.0. Musk himself has stated that when they designed v1.0 they "didn't really know what we were doing". The Falcon 9 v1.1 has a larger payload capacity, has a more reliable design, and is built using simpler and cheaper manufacturing processes. The main differences between the v1.0 and v1.1 include the use of the more powerful Merlin 1D engine, an "octaweb" engine layout which replaces the older "tic-tac-toe" layout on the first stage, and stretched propellant tanks that are 60% larger on the first and second stage.

## What are the differences between Falcon 9 v1.1 and the upgraded Falcon version popularly called the v1.2?

In March 2015, [Elon Musk tweeted](https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/572257004938403840) about a series of 3 upgrades planned for the F9v1.1: 1) Increasing the available thrust of the M1D engines ~15%.  2) Subchilling the propellants, which increases their densities--allowing more to be loaded in the same volume.  3) Increasing the volume of the upper stage by 10%.  Though it is currently unknown what SpaceX will choose to officially call it, when taken together, a Falcon 9 that includes all three changes is popularly referred to as v1.2.  The switch to the new version may also include other small changes/modifications as yet unannounced by SpaceX.

The cumulative effect of the changes is to [increase F9 performance ~30%](https://twitter.com/pbdes/status/577879010262188033) and thereby allow recovery of boosters even on heavy GTO launches. On F9v1.1 launches, these high-energy flight profiles require too much performance to be able to recover boosters. SpaceX launched the first F9v1.2 in December 2015, carrying the OG2-2 satellites to Low Earth Orbit.

## What are the launch commit criteria for a Falcon 9 launch?



## What happens to the Falcon second stages after payload separation?

The second stages are left in orbit until they decay, or, as of more recently, deliberately deorbited if in Low Earth Orbit to reduce orbital debris, as was done on the CRS-3 & CRS-4 missions. Previous stages have used the former approach or have been boosted into higher orbits for a variety of reasons (such as testing the second stage engine's relight capability). For missions where the Falcon upper stage is injected into GTO, such as SES-8 & Thaicom 6, they are left in these orbits, as the perigee (usually around 180-300km) is low enough that drag will remove the stage from orbit after 2-12 months.

## What is the blue Stargate-looking camera view shown during launch?

[This camera view](https://i.imgur.com/WRp2ujX.gifv) shows the inside of the second stage LOX tank. What you are looking at is Liquid Oxygen floating around in microgravity. LOX is a pale blue color whereas RP-1 is pale yellow, and the RP-1 tank has the the LOX transfer tube running through the center of it, whereas this tank doesn't. We know it's on the second stage because the liquid reacts to the microgravity of spaceflight at the same time the second stage's engines are cut off.

## What is the engine-out capability of Falcon Heavy?

It's unlikely you can simplify such a complicated system down to a single 'engine out' rule with Falcon Heavy. It's already reasonably complicated with Falcon 9 (two engine failures must occur at optimum times for this to be possible), but two additional cores makes it impossible to calculate without having detailed access to Falcon Heavy's design. There'd likely be dozens of multiple scenarios for engine-out events dependent on when the engine fails, which engine failed, and what payload mass is being carried.

## What is the likelihood of the Merlin-engined Falcon's fuel being changed from kerosene to methane?



## What just fell off the second stage engine bell?

[That is the second stage engine nozzle stiffener ring](http://www.spacex.com/files/assets/img/20100618_F91_14.jpg). The bell nozzle on the MVac engine is not very rigid (this is for a variety of reasons, most importantly are weight savings, and ensuring good thermal radiative properties to keep it cool), especially when the engine is not firing. The ring keeps the nozzle from flexing too much during the first stage burn. After the MVac is ignited, the positive pressure from the engine firing pushes on the inside of the nozzle which prevents it from flexing, so the stabilizer ring is no longer needed. It breaks off and falls away, as it is designed to do.

## What were Falcon X & Falcon XX?

The Falcon X was proposed in 2010, but those plans were shelved, and is no longer in current development. The design configurations shown by Tom Markusic were only conceptual "brainstorming ideas", just a "bunch of ideas for discussion," and not financed SpaceX projects.

## Who decides to terminate Falcon if something goes wrong?



## Why can't you attach more cores to Falcon Heavy to make a 'Falcon Superheavy'?

Because the downsides outweigh the positives. The only advantage is a slightly higher payload. While this seems like a good idea, adding more cores gets even more complex and provides even less benefit. Adding two cores to a single-stick Falcon 9 increases the acceleration at launch, increasing the payload. But with another two cores, this effect is even smaller. And since fuel crossfeed has been dropped due to complexity, KSP-like asparagus staging isn't possible. There is also the possibility of the payload not fitting into the 5-meter fairing. Possibly the most significant difficulty is that the rocket no longer sits flat on its side. This might seem unimportant, but having the rocket sit all on one level makes integration much easier. SpaceX would need new equipment to assemble the rocket, and this equipment would only be used on the occasional Falcon Superheavy launch. Finally, this makes reuse even more tricky. Because either there will be three core separation events, or four cores landing at once. Comparing the minor benefits with the major difficulties, a Falcon Superheavy isn't practical enough for SpaceX to pursue.

## Why does Falcon have 4 legs? Wouldn't more legs provide better redundancy?



## Why does half of Falcon look black or dirty after it has landed?  Why is the other half still white or clean? What causes this distinctive pattern?



## Why does the bottom of Falcon glow green during ignition?

The chemicals used to ignite the engines are Triethylaluminum and Triethylborane (TEA-TEB). Triethylborane is strongly pyrophoric, igniting spontaneously in air, burning with an apple-green flame characteristic for a boron compound.
