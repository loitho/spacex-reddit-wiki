# NASA, Air Force, & Politics

## How much does SpaceX spend lobbying Congress?

In 2015, SpaceX spent over $1.3 million on lobbying ([source](http://www.politico.com/story/2015/12/space-star-wars-elon-musk-boeing-lockheed-martin-217182)), and $1.5 million in 2014 ([source](http://spaceksc.blogspot.co.uk/2015/07/house-for-sale.html)). This is more than their rival ULA directly spent ($900k in 2015, $1 million in 2014), though possibly less when you take into account ULA's parent companies Boeing and Lockheed Martin, who each spend over $10 million apiece.

## How would SpaceX develop without NASA contracts?

Musk has indicated that SpaceX will continue development of manned flight capabilities, regardless of whether SpaceX are granted a NASA Commercial Crew contract or not. The first manned flight of Dragon 2 (Demo-2) has a NET date of March 2017.

## What are the contracts that SpaceX and other companies have signed with NASA?

It's best to delineate the programs along two tracks: cargo and crew.

**Cargo** (COTS, CRS, CRS2)

* **COTS** ([Commercial Orbital Transportation Services](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commercial_Orbital_Transportation_Services)): program to fund development and demonstration flights of commercial orbital cargo transportation services. I suggest reading the [final COTS report](http://www.nasa.gov/content/nasa-releases-cots-final-report/#.VJBoyyvF98E) for a really comprehensive background.
* **CRS** ([Commercial Resupply Services](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commercial_Resupply_Services)): contracts for ongoing delivery of cargo to the ISS. SpaceX's next CRS mission will be CRS-8, with a NET date of January 3rd. CRS2 will be a new contract (so new competition), starting deliveries around 2016; you can see the [Request for Proposal](http://procurement.jsc.nasa.gov/crs2/) (RFP) here. It is between Lockheed-Martin's Exoliner, Sierra Nevada's Dreamchaser, Orbital ATK's Cygnus, and SpaceX.

**Crew [(CCDev)](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commercial_Crew_Development)** (phases: CCDev1, CCDev2, CCiCap, CPC, CCtCap)

* **CCDev1** ([Commercial Crew Development 1](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commercial_Crew_Development#CCDev_1)): Space Act Agreements to develop some technologies and systems for human spaceflight. Note that SpaceX was not a participant in CCDev1.
* **CCDev2** ([Commercial Crew Development 2](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commercial_Crew_Development#CCDev_2)): Proposals for development of vehicles for human spaceflight to the ISS. Several proposals were selected for funding and others were unfunded. Funded ones were Blue Origin, SNC, SpaceX, and Boeing.
* **CCiCap** ([Commercial Crew Integrated Capability](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commercial_Crew_Development#Commercial_Crew_integrated_Capability)): Proposals for a complete design of crew services including the spacecraft, launch vehicle, services, and recovery. Winners were SpaceX, SNC, and Boeing. Boeing has completed all of their CCiCap milestones; SNC and SpaceX are finishing theirs up. Note that milestones are different for each company, mostly due to the fact that each company started out CCiCap at different points in the development process.
* **CPC** ([Certification Products Contract](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commercial_Crew_Development#Certification_Products_Contract_.28CPC.29_phase_1)): Review of the integrated systems and progress towards developing a certification plan. All CCiCap winners continue through this phase.
* **CCtCap** ([Commercial Crew Transportation Capability](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commercial_Crew_Development#Commercial_Crew_Transportation_Capability_.28CCtCap.29)): the program for certification of the spacecraft/launch vehicle systems for human spaceflight, including their final phases of development, testing, and verification. Culminates in manned test flights to the ISS, after which some other CRS-like contract will begin for purchasing of routine crew flights. Winners were SpaceX and Boeing.

## What are the details of SpaceX's Raptor upper stage engine contract with the Air Force?



## What government oversight was present for the CRS-7 & AMOS-6 incidents?



## What is SpaceX's relationship with NASA?

SpaceX provides a service to NASA - SpaceX are one of several companies that launch things into orbit for NASA. In other words, NASA is a customer of SpaceX - just one of many customers of SpaceX, though they are actually their largest single customer in terms of monetary value of contracts.

## What payloads have SpaceX launched for NASA & the Air Force?



## Why do ULA use the foreign-made RD-180 engine on their rockets?

First, it's worth a quick look at why the US opted to allow a foreign engine in a rocket which lifts the majority of its national security launches. The RD-180 was first studied by General Dynamics (before they became part of Lockheed Martin), and [first flown on an Atlas III](http://www.ilslaunch.com/newsroom/news-releases/lockheed-martin-selects-rd-180-power-atlas-iiar) (also known as Atlas IIAR). The general idea, which was encouraged by the US government, was that Russia had a lot of really smart rocket scientists who were suddenly out of a job after the fall of the USSR. It wouldn't be good for those engineers to pack up and leave for a hostile country, so the US wanted to encourage them to work on something positive. A great price on the best hydrocarbon engine in the world [\(literally, US engineers didn't believe the Russians until witnessing a test](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AyBan_LTjvM) ) only sweetened the deal.

But of course, you need to have a backup plan. An original plan from [1995 required co-production capability within four years](http://www.spacepolitics.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/Mitchell_Report_May2014.pdf). However, that was early enough that there was still serious skepticism by the US on the part of the former Soviet Union.
Backup plans though, are extremely expensive. Maintaining co-production capability, even given four years to ramp it up, takes a significant amount of man power. Among other things, you need to pay to keep drawings, have engineers keep up proficiency, train incoming workers, and have long lead parts on hand. And you have to do this all for something that won't make money for your company. The government recognized this, and it soon approved a co-production extension (basically saying we'll allow the time you need to build an engine to be more than four years).

As years went on, relations with Russia warmed and the commercial launch industry sank. The costs of maintaining production were so high that the government agreed to remove the requirement altogether. In 2008, ["the decision was made to conclude the program \[of co-production\], partly because of the commercial market downturn. The resulting lower launch rate did not provide a robust business case for building a U.S. production facility.](http://forum.nasaspaceflight.com/index.php?PHPSESSID=bi1d2tl1lmgtq0ehdt8ff7f223&topic=14224.0;all)" The general idea was that Delta IV, combined with a US stockpile of RD-180 engines, would be enough to ride out any bumps in the supply chain.

Post-2008, it becomes pretty clear why ULA did not maintain immediate capability to build an RD-180. Supply of the engines was never really in doubt (even since Rogozin made his comments, [every engine has arrived on time](http://spacenews.com/41622ula-takes-delivery-of-two-rd-180-rocket-engines-from-russia/)) until we shot ourselves in the foot with the 2015 National Defense Authorization Act. (*Edit: Access was restored with the most recent omnibus spending bill*)

Now, even if this whole backstory didn't complicate the issue enough, the currently in force 2015 explicitly prohibits "[a contract for the procurement of property or services for space launch activities under the evolved expendable launch vehicle program if such contract carries out such space launch activities using rocket engines designed or manufactured in the Russian Federation](http://www.armed-services.senate.gov/imo/media/doc/CPRT-113-HPRT-RU00-S1847.pdf). [See page 844 - large PDF warning for people on mobile]".  A domestic RD-180 would still have been designed in Russia, eliminating it from use.
