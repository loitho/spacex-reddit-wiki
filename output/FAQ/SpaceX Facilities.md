# SpaceX Facilities

## Does SpaceX have any operations outside of the United States?

Because of ITAR limitations, SpaceX is unlikely to have any operations outside the U.S. for the foreseeable future. It is possible they might create a sister company that develops things not subject to ITAR at some point, but the vertically integrated nature of SpaceX makes this unlikely.

## Does SpaceX publish a testing schedule for McGregor, Texas?

There is no published public testing schedule for McGregor, although engines are tested almost daily. Occasionally the local news will publish a warning of an upcoming "louder than usual" test (usually a full nine-engine firing) roughly one day in advance, but no time for the test will be given. Additionally, SpaceX have no incentive to make such tests publicly visible as it may draw unwanted attention to any potential failures on the test stand.

## What are the four towers around the SLC-40 launch pad for?

These are lightning towers; they prevent lightning from hitting and so damaging or destroying the rocket on the launch pad. Because Florida experiences a [lot of lightning](http://www.lightningsafety.noaa.gov/stats/97-11Flash_Density_miles.png), all active launch complexes in the area need to have them. [Lightning have actually hit the towers](https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/508457119037681665), just before the AsiaSat 6 launch.

SpaceX's other Florida Pad, 39A, includes a single lightning tower mounted atop the Fixed Service Structure. Because Vandenberg experiences generally fine weather, situated in a mediterranean climate; it has no need for lightning towers and thus does not have them.

## What is a Autonomous Spaceport Drone Ship (ASDS)?

The ASDS, or Autonomous Spaceport Drone Ship, is an ocean-going, barge-derived, floating landing platform used by SpaceX began as landing platforms for boosters recovery at sea. The original ASDS that has been used for all landing attempts in the first half of 2015 was the Marmac 300, which was named by Elon Musk as *Just Read The Instructions*. In mid 2015, Marmac 300 was returned to the owners (the barges are only rented), and SpaceX took delivery of Marmac 303 and Marmac 304. Marmac 304 is currently on the East Coast for catching stages launched from Cape Canaveral, Florida. This barge has been named *Of Course I Still Love You*. Marmac 303 was bought through the Panama Canal to the West Coast and moored at LA, in order to catch future stages launched from Vandenberg, California. This barge was again named *Just Read The Instructions*. The names are references to ships from the late Iain M. Banks' Culture novels.

## What is the intended use of SpaceX's private Boca Chica, Texas launch site?

The Texas launch site is planned to absorb SpaceX's (predicted) overcapacity caused by currently having a single launch site that can boost directly into LEO/GTO. It will mainly be used for commercial missions (such as comsats), while most Dragon-related and human-rated missions will be flown out of SLC-40. Pad 39A will take up the military/defense related missions and perhaps some human-rated missions too. Saying that, even Pad9A is unlikely to be big enough for BFR/MCT, so it is possible that SpaceX will have 3 launch sites in Florida one day. Additionally, having a private launch site is advantageous as SpaceX will not need to work around launch times for other range customers (such as the Air Force and government - missions whose priority usually exceed that of a commercial launch), which has been a source of delays in the past.

## Why do SpaceX have both East Coast and West Coast launchpads?

Orbital mechanics & current U.S. law requires it! There is a general aversion to flying over land as this creates risk to those in the flight path below you due to the possibility of a malfunction or vehicle breakup. Because of this, the vast majority of launches are conducted where the trajectory takes the vehicle over the ocean.

As a result, SpaceX uses their east coast launch sites to launch into low inclination orbits straddling the equator, such as Low Earth Orbit or Geostationary Transfer Orbit, by flying out over the Atlantic Ocean. They use their west coast launch site to launch into high inclination orbits, such as Polar Orbit, or Sun Synchronous Orbit, by flying south over the Pacific.
