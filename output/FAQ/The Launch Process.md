# The Launch Process

## What happens to the Falcon second stages after payload separation?

The second stages are left in orbit until they decay, or, as of more recently, deliberately deorbited if in Low Earth Orbit to reduce orbital debris, as was done on the CRS-3 & CRS-4 missions. Previous stages have used the former approach or have been boosted into higher orbits for a variety of reasons (such as testing the second stage engine's relight capability). For missions where the Falcon upper stage is injected into GTO, such as SES-8 & Thaicom 6, they are left in these orbits, as the perigee (usually around 180-300km) is low enough that drag will remove the stage from orbit after 2-12 months.

## During a static fire, how do the launch clamps hold down the rocket and prevent it taking off?



## How much does a launch scrub cost SpaceX?

It's obviously not possible to come up with a fixed value for such a relatively unique event (as obviously a scrub where they launch the following day would be cheaper than a scrub where they need to bring the rocket back to horizontal and check it over), but we can estimate the costs that SpaceX would incur. Everyone at SpaceX is likely salaried, and the pad crew (who may or may not actually qualify as a salaried job) probably are too. So the overtime to be paid is likely minimal. They have to pay the Air Force to do launches from CCAFS, but only they and the AF know how that is structured and what a scrub costs. There's probably a fixed cost for reconfiguring the range for another launch if the delay is long enough that someone else launches between attempts. If they get to pressurization then they are likely losing a lot of helium, which is more expensive than the entire load of LOX. In addition, recovery assets also need to be paid. Fuel for a big ship is not cheap to go out a few hundred miles and return.

## What are the four towers around the SLC-40 launch pad for?

These are lightning towers; they prevent lightning from hitting and so damaging or destroying the rocket on the launch pad. Because Florida experiences a [lot of lightning](http://www.lightningsafety.noaa.gov/stats/97-11Flash_Density_miles.png), all active launch complexes in the area need to have them. [Lightning have actually hit the towers](https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/508457119037681665), just before the AsiaSat 6 launch.

SpaceX's other Florida Pad, 39A, includes a single lightning tower mounted atop the Fixed Service Structure. Because Vandenberg experiences generally fine weather, situated in a mediterranean climate; it has no need for lightning towers and thus does not have them.

## What is falling off the rocket just after liftoff?

Water ice. As the LOX tank of Falcon is extremely cold, ice builds up on the outside skin of the launch vehicle - condensed from the warm, humid surrounding air. It's an inevitable but harmless result of storing cryogenic materials in uninsulated tanks (it isn't a big enough problem to be worth the extra weight and bulk of adding insulation). Naturally, as it isn't firmly attached to the rocket, a lot of it ends up falling off during ascent due to the vibrations and aerodynamics of launch, and can be frequently seen falling away on the camera feed. Backlit against the glow of the rocket engines, it can make for a very photogenic sight!

## What is the blue Stargate-looking camera view shown during launch?

[This camera view](https://i.imgur.com/WRp2ujX.gifv) shows the inside of the second stage LOX tank. What you are looking at is Liquid Oxygen floating around in microgravity. LOX is a pale blue color whereas RP-1 is pale yellow, and the RP-1 tank has the the LOX transfer tube running through the center of it, whereas this tank doesn't. We know it's on the second stage because the liquid reacts to the microgravity of spaceflight at the same time the second stage's engines are cut off.

## What just fell off the second stage engine bell?

[That is the second stage engine nozzle stiffener ring](http://www.spacex.com/files/assets/img/20100618_F91_14.jpg). The bell nozzle on the MVac engine is not very rigid (this is for a variety of reasons, most importantly are weight savings, and ensuring good thermal radiative properties to keep it cool), especially when the engine is not firing. The ring keeps the nozzle from flexing too much during the first stage burn. After the MVac is ignited, the positive pressure from the engine firing pushes on the inside of the nozzle which prevents it from flexing, so the stabilizer ring is no longer needed. It breaks off and falls away, as it is designed to do.

## What's the white mist venting from the rocket before liftoff?

Prior to launch, the Falcon propellant tanks are filled with Kerosene and LOX (Liquid Oxygen). On F9v1.1 and earlier, the LOX was continuously boiling and evaporating, so they had the need to vent the invisible oxygen gas from the rocket. This gas is still very cold, and as it mixes with the ambient air, it dramatically cools it down. The air in Florida is humid, meaning it contains a lot of invisible gaseous water. As the warm humid air meets the freezing oxygen gas vented from the rocket, the atmospheric water turns from invisible gas into a visible liquid aerosol (also known as water vapor). This is what you're seeing.

With Falcon 9 v1.2, the LOX propellant is kept considerably more chilled to densify it, at temperatures of approximately -207°C (-340°F); and the RP-1 is kept at -7°C (20F).

## Why do SpaceX have both East Coast and West Coast launchpads?

Orbital mechanics & current U.S. law requires it! There is a general aversion to flying over land as this creates risk to those in the flight path below you due to the possibility of a malfunction or vehicle breakup. Because of this, the vast majority of launches are conducted where the trajectory takes the vehicle over the ocean.

As a result, SpaceX uses their east coast launch sites to launch into low inclination orbits straddling the equator, such as Low Earth Orbit or Geostationary Transfer Orbit, by flying out over the Atlantic Ocean. They use their west coast launch site to launch into high inclination orbits, such as Polar Orbit, or Sun Synchronous Orbit, by flying south over the Pacific.

## Why does the bottom of Falcon glow green during ignition?

The chemicals used to ignite the engines are Triethylaluminum and Triethylborane (TEA-TEB). Triethylborane is strongly pyrophoric, igniting spontaneously in air, burning with an apple-green flame characteristic for a boron compound.

## Why is Helium so difficult to work with?
