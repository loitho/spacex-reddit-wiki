# Working at SpaceX

## How can I get a tour at SpaceX?

Tours aren't open to the general public, and you can only get one if you are personally invited by a SpaceX employee; or have NASA or Air Force accreditation. However, please **do not request invites** from the employees who browse here, as it annoys them, and there's too much potential for it to go wrong. In order to visit SpaceX property, you have to be a US person (Citizen, Naturalized Citizen, or LPR) due to ITAR requirements (though exceptions have been made). However, everyone is welcome to watch the following video tours of the [Hawthorne factory](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TQ6tZtGrShg), the [McGregor test site,](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bdvv8qIl_WI) and the [Cape Canaveral launch site.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_FlhbMraqxA)

## How should I handle myself at a group hiring event?

What SpaceX look for most in engineering candidates is the ability to get things done. SpaceX want candidates who can start a project, hit problems, work past them, and produce at the end of the day. The best recommendation is to focus on the projects you worked on, what did you build, how did you build it, what went wrong, what went right. Above all be prepared to talk about the entire project; if SpaceX ask you about some part of the project and you say weren't responsible that portion and you don't know, that is a red flag that you are bullshitting us.

The best candidates that SpaceX want to hire are the ones who worked on projects, and actually managed to produce things. SpaceX fear people with academic knowledge that have no evidence of ever applying that knowledge. In general, SpaceX hire from better schools and people with better grades, but that probably reflects more that people who know how to get things done end up in those places than that SpaceX actually look for those things.

## I'm not a United States citizen, can I work for SpaceX?

In general, it is more difficult to find work at SpaceX if you weren't born in the US. It is only possible to work at SpaceX if you are classified as "US Person", which means you need to be a citizen, naturalized citizen, or legal permanent resident. The reason why SpaceX avoid hiring foreign nationals is ITAR, which controls the exchange of certain  types of information, including rocket design. If SpaceX decide you are worth the effort, they may sponsor you to get a Green Card, and Canadian citizens have found work at SpaceX by possessing a TN Visa and an ITAR exemption license. The official SpaceX wording is as follows (from a typical job posting):

> To conform to U.S. Government space technology export regulations, applicant must be a U.S. citizen, lawful permanent resident of the U.S., protected individual as defined by 8 U.S.C. 1324b(a)(3), or eligible to obtain the required authorizations from the U.S. Department of State.

## My jobs-related question isn't answered here: where can I find more info?

## What is the working environment at SpaceX like?

SpaceX, even though it was founded over 12 years ago, continues to retain a start-up culture typical of many new businesses in California in part by demanding solid working hours and active participation, because of this working for a company this aggressive is a lifestyle choice, not "just a job." Prospective employees should know that going in. If you want a regular vanilla job there are lots of other opportunities in California.

## What qualities are SpaceX looking for?

SpaceX look for people who can strongly demonstrate initiative, drive and intelligence. Formal training in mechanical/electrical/software engineering at college would stand you in very good stead. In addition, SpaceX are always interested to hear about extra-curricular activities: that bottle rocket you built at age 8, the door you fixed at 10, the boxcar you built at 12, that website you designed at 14, the bridge you engineered at 16, etc. In particular, SpaceX seem to like people who have taken part in Formula SAE, or have experience in video game development. Emphasize your ability to fix problems with ingenuity and personal drive; being able to do this is almost more important than is an engineering degree. Normally, you have to be a US person (Citizen, Naturalized Citizen, or LPR) due to ITAR requirements (but exceptions have been made).

## What sort of jobs are available at SpaceX?

SpaceX are a large and growing aerospace company with a huge variety positions  available. The highest profile jobs are the engineering corps, who design and refine the systems and architectures required for successful spaceflight. But if you don't have a head for engineering, there is still a place for everyone at SpaceX. The factory floor is manned by hundreds of machinists and technicians who actually build the equipment that flies to orbit. SpaceX also need people to fill their HR, PR, QA, sales, legal and finance departments. If you don't like the idea of working in a factory in LA, there are opportunities to work at the launch pads or the R&D centers.
