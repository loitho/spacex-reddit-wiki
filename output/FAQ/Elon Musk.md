# Elon Musk

## Who is Elon Musk?

Elon Reeve Musk (born June 28, 1971) is a South Africa-born, Canadian American inventor, engineer and entrepreneur. He is the CEO and CTO of SpaceX, CEO and chief product architect of Tesla Motors, chairman of SolarCity, and co-chairman of OpenAI. He is the founder of SpaceX and a cofounder of PayPal, Tesla Motors, and Zip2. He has also envisioned a conceptual high-speed transportation system known as the Hyperloop.

## Why did Elon Musk found SpaceX?

Elon Musk founded SpaceX out of frustration with the slow technological development pace of human spaceflight. After trying to negotiate a launch with the purpose of landing a "greenhouse" on Mars in order to reinvigorate NASA, Musk quickly realised that the reason for slow progress was no lack of will, but the extraordinarily high cost of putting something - anything - into orbit.

The primary aim of SpaceX from the outset was to build a simple and relatively inexpensive reusable rocket system that could go into space multiple times, with a similar turn-around time capabilities that commercial airliners currently exhibit. By enabling cheap and easy access to space, the idea is that this will enable humans to settle other planets, and become a multi-planet species.

## Has Elon Musk taken part in an AMA (Ask Me Anything)?

Three times. Elon Musk recently did an AMA in r/SpaceX in October 2016, discussing SpaceX's Mars Architecture, [which you can read here](https://redd.it/590wi9).

In January 2015, Musk hosted a more conventional AMA in r/IAmA, discussing SpaceX, [see the thread here](http://www.redd.it/2rgsan).

Musk hosted a video AMA in September 2011, also in r/IAmA, touching on a number of topics. ([Thread](http://redd.it/kkn5v), [Video Responses](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EzoqMz9QfEg)).

Musk has promised to participate in a fourth AMA as soon as a landed Falcon is relaunched, which was scheduled for NET late 2016.
