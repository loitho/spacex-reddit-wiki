## What is Red Dragon?

Red Dragon is a proposed NASA/SETI Institute mission to send a modified Dragon capsule atop a Falcon Heavy to the Martian surface. The mission would be an unmanned scientific lander, and the heaviest object ever to be placed on Mars - it alone could carry an additional 2 metric tons of cargo and equipment down to the surface. There have been no official announcements about the mission from SpaceX as the mission design architecture is not managed by them, and there is currently no indication that the project will be funded.

## How can methane fuel be manufactured on Mars?

Methane and oxygen can be manufactured on Mars, using the resources already present on the red planet (this is known as In-Situ Resource Utilisation). By taking the abundant (96%) carbon dioxide present in the atmosphere, and hydrogen either imported from Earth, or hydrolysed from Martian permafrost, it is possibly to chemically react the two together in such a way to produce fuel and oxidiser. These can then be burned together as propellant for orbital launch, or in a rover engine for getting around on the surface, or for warmth in a habitat. Furthermore, the oxygen is extremely useful for creating a breathable atmosphere, and methane can be used as a feedstock for producing plastics. As a side product, carbon monoxide can be used for low-temperature smelting of metals.

The exact process in question is the [Sabatier reaction](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sabatier_reaction), which makes use of the abundant carbon dioxide in the Martian atmosphere. The overall equation for making methane and oxygen fuel is as follows:

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2 CO*_2_* + 2 H*_2_* → CH*_4_* + 2 O*_2_* + C

This is actually several different reaction steps combined into one:

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;CO*_2_* + 4 H*_2_* → CH*_4_* + 2 H*_2_*O

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2 H*_2_*O → 2 H*_2_*+ O*_2_*

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;CH*_4_* → C + 2 H*_2_*

Alternatively, you have the reverse water gas-shift reaction, which is as follows:

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2 H*_2_* + 3 CO*_2_* → CH*_4_* + 2 O*_2_* + 2 CO

## How long does it take to get to Mars?

Mars is a long, long way away. At their closest possible approach, Earth and Mars are still 34 million miles (55 million km) apart. If you look at a list of transit times for all previous robotic probes that successfully transited to Mars (ignoring outliers Dawn and Rosetta), you see that the average transit time is a little under 8 months:

This transit time depends massively on the relative distance between Earth and Mars, and also on the amount of fuel you have to burn. Robotic probes often take the lowest energy approach, which takes longer. One of the main problems is that every unit of speed you put on the craft to make the trip shorter is an extra amount you have to get rid of when you get there. It is, however, a fair assumption that future manned missions to Mars will allow for a higher energy burn in order to lower the transit time to something a little more reasonable, perhaps 6 months or less.

## What does Elon Musk mean when he says Mars is a "fixer-upper of a planet"?

Mars is a planet that is currently hostile to life; Musk is talking about the process of terraforming it to make it less hostile. Lots of terraforming discussions mention things like giant space mirrors, without ever considering how ridiculously huge and impossible these would be. Using currently available technologies, Mars could be warmed up by the use of greenhouse gases. On Earth, carbon dioxide warms the atmosphere, as it (through the process of absorption and emission of radiation) "reflects" heat back at the planet. But it's not that efficient, and there are lots of other gases that have a better "Global-Warming Potential". The best candidate by far is sulfur hexafluoride (SF*_6_*), which has a GWP of tens of thousands better than CO*_2_*. SF*_6_* could be easily produced on Mars - giant factories could be built, belching the stuff into the atmosphere. It is also extremely dense, so clings to the surface, and settles at the bottom of craters and valleys, where colonists would most likely be living. As the planet warms, the CO*_2_* permafrost will melt, boosting atmospheric pressure, and warming the planet further in a runaway greenhouse effect.

## How dangerous are the perchlorate salts found in Martian soil?

Perchlorate salts, such as calcium perchlorate (Ca(ClO*_4_*)*_2_*), are widespread in Martian soils at concentrations between 0.5 and 1%. At such concentrations, perchlorates represent a significant chemical hazard to astronauts. Perchlorates are toxic as they interfere with thyroid function, if they get in your bloodstream. They're also a fairly nasty irritant to exposed skin, due to their oxidising nature. However, though the hazard is large, the risk need not be.

It's important to understand that all chemicals are poisonous above a certain threshold particular to that compound. The management of hazardous chemicals (those with a relatively low threshold) focuses on keeping their concentration below that threshold in locations where they can cause harm. When using the appropriate Personal Protective Equipment, and the right safety procedures, perchlorates should never come into contact with human tissue. Contaminated suits can easily be decontaminate: calcium perchlorate is very soluble in water; 188 grams will dissolve in 100 millilitres of water at 20 °C. Once you have it in aqueous solution, it should be easy to deal with. Perchlorates are pretty reactive (there's a reason they were used in the shuttle solid rocket boosters!), and so can be neutralised through a variety of chemical pathways. Even if that fails, you can just blast them with heat. Calcium perchlorate decomposes above ~300 °C into calcium chloride, calcium oxide and usable oxygen gas.

## What might the Martian habitats look like?

At first, colonists would be living out of the BFS on which they arrived. More 'lander can' style habitats would follow, perhaps landed in the same area to form a small 'town' of habitation modules. Ultimately though, colonists would have to learn to live off the land, and use the resources available to them to build habitats of their own.

Roman vaults could be built out of Martian bricks. Mars has everything you need to make bricks, and Roman vaults are incredibly strong and roomy load-bearing structures. Pile dust and dirt on top, and you have radiation shielding. If you model the atmosphere of the Martian hab after than of Skylab (3.5 psi oxygen, 1.5 psi nitrogen), the vaults experience 3.5 tonne per square metre force trying to explode the structure upwards; a layer of dirt 3 metres thick will be more than enough to contain that. This structure would leak air, but slowly due to the mass of compressed material it has to escape through. Spray the internal surface with some sort of epoxy resin, and you slow the loss dramatically. Furthermore, any leaks should be self sealing, as the warm humid internal air leaks out into the cold soil, it forms leak-blocking permafrost to form in the diffusion paths though the soil roof.

## What plants might grow on Mars?

All higher plants would die in Mars' current state. Some plants (lichens, mosses) might tolerate Mars' cold periods, and grow only in the warmer >0 °C periods, but they'd grow very slowly, and have virtually no effect on the planet. All plants need oxygen, which Mars lacks. Plants on Earth have evolved to live in an oxidising atmosphere with a reducing soil. Mars has the exact opposite (no oxygen in the atmosphere, far too many perchlorates in the soil), which would need to be remedied by chemical processes before plants can take a hold, processes sped up by warming the planet. Marian soil is rich in inorganic nutrients, but has zero organic nutrients, so it'd be like when plants colonise volcanic soil on Earth. The rules of biological succession show that simple plants will arrive first, colonising the area in successively complex waves until higher plants can survive. The Isle of Surtsey is a good example.

## What will colonists do to stop Mars' terraformed atmosphere being lost to the solar wind?

While it is true that the solar wind has stripped Mars of much of its original atmosphere (due to the lack of the planet's magnetic field), and that any man-made atmosphere on Mars would eventually be dissipated by the solar wind - the speed at which this occurs is measured over geological time frames - on the scale of tens, if not hundreds of millions of years. If humanity were to create an artificial, life-conducive atmosphere on Mars, any atmospheric output due to economic activity (CO*_2_* + other gases) would easily exceed any atmospheric losses. Thus, the atmosphere would be stable.

## Why colonize Mars?

This question is best answered by Elon Musk and Gwynne Shotwell themselves:

> "What are the important steps in the evolution of life? Obviously there is the advent of single celled life, there was differentiation between plants and animals, there was life going from the oceans onto land, there was mammals, consciousness, and I would argue also on that scale, should fit life becoming multi-planetary. And I think, that if one could make a reasonable argument that something is important enough to fit on the scale of evolution, then it is important. And maybe worth a little bit of our resources."

\- Elon Musk

> "I think there are two perspectives that are important. Exploration is really what separates humans from other living species. If we decide that where we are today is 'it,' that seems like a big disappointment. The other piece, the kinda scary piece, is it's really risk management for humanity. The probability of a significant event happening on Earth is very high. When will it happen? I don't know when it will happen, but I'm pretty sure there will be a catastrophic event, and it would be nice to have humans living in more than one spot. [...] I cannot think of anything more important than promoting humanity beyond a single location. We're a single point failure!"

## Would space-based solar power for a Martian colony be useful?

Orbital solar arrays have been proposed in the past to get around the problem of efficiency losses due to atmospheric scattering on Earth. On Mars, solar panels would also have to deal with dust deposition. However, Elon Musk has been firm in his opposition to space-based solar power: since a solar array would have to first convert photons (from the sun) into electrons (electricity), then convert that electricity into microwave power for transmission to the ground (photons again), then on the ground convert those photons back into electricity, that means that the extra conversions would wipe out even a two-fold increase in incident solar power that could be achieved by putting the panels in orbit. Add on the fact that it costs money and energy to put things into orbit, and [it simply "super-doesn't work"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gVgM2BlMczY#t=41m55s). Unless solar panels in space are able to put out many times the energy of solar panels on Mars, it doesn't make sense to put them in orbit.
